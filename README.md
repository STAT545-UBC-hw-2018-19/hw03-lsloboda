## Reflection

*This assignment was a useful review of the in class exercises, especially cm003, cm004, cm005 and cm006. I had some difficulty setting up the repo using Git Classroom because I didn't recall that the link to create the repo was in Canvas. However, once I created the repo, I then linked it to my local RStudio folder and created the necessary files. I had some confusion around how to create a .md file until I realized that I could just type the extension into the file name. I referred to the class exercises and online resources such as stack exchange to help me with the assignment. I also received a tip from a classmate about how to add a value calculated from an r script directly into my text output.*
